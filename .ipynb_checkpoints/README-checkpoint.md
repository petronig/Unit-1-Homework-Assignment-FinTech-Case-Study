## Overview and Origin

* Kabbage, Inc.

* Incorporated February 12, 2009, based in Atlanta, Georgia

* Founders:
    * Rob Frohwein, CEO
    * Kathryn Petralia, President and "Kabbagehead"
    * Marc Gorlin

* The founders saw an opportunity during the 2008 financial crisis to use AI to make small business lending more efficient and profitable, without the high standards of cash flow, credit score or collateral required by banks.

* The company is privately held and funded by venture capital. Funding: $489 million as of 2021 from SoftBank Vision Fund, BlueRun Ventures, Mohr Davidow Ventures and others. Latest valuation: $1.2 billion

## Business Activities:

* Kabbage has focused on the cash flow obstacles faced by small businesses, both in initial funding and operations. Their suite of products includes Kabbage Payments, which assists small businesses in collecting payment and getting fast access to the earned money, and Kabbage Funding which provides access to flexible lines of credit in minutes.

* The target customer base has been small businesses. The lines of credit extended are up to $250, 000 to those approved. As of 2020 Kabbage has provided loans to 220,000 small U.S. firms equating to $9 Billion in working capital.  The company claims that in three steps taking less than 10 minutes to transact, a small business may apply and potentially be approved for a credit line. They are able to do this having built the machine learning algorithms that allow extracting the real-time business data of the customers rather than relying on traditional bank statements and other static financial documents. 

* In the midst of the pandemic, with many small businesses collapsing and their customer base suddenly disappearing (there were employee furloughs at Kabbage summer of 2020), Kabbage re-invented its purpose by participating in the government funded Paycheck Protection Program which allows for companies to apply for 10 weeks of relief funding to pay employees impacted by the pandemic.  Kabbage provided over 130,000 PPP loans averaging $29,000.  Over 80\% of Kabbage's PPP recipients were firms of five employees or fewer that did not have established relationships with banks. 

* Kabbage uses AI algorithms to analyze data and information from several sources including real-time cash flow data, bank accounts, e-commerce transactions, and online reviews, to evaluate the financial health of applicants. They also uses data sources, such as Amazon.com ratings, to evaluate individual creditworthiness and determine loan amounts. Kabbage licenses its algorithmic underwriting technology and monitoring services to other financial institutions who then use its software to serve their small and medium-size business customers. As described by founder Kathryn Petralia:
> We just call it 'AI-blockchain-crypto tech'

## Landscape:

* Kabbage crosses over the two financial industry domains of Payments/Billing and Lending.

* The innovating trend over the past decade has been the accessibility of business funding to smaller firms and also to on-line and e-commerce companies.  The financial needs of these firms could not be served, or were ignored by traditional banking systems that could not economically serve the sector.  The traditional requirements of three years banking history, financial statement, and tax history have been disrupted creating opportunity for small businesses to access growth capital. 

* Aside from traditional lenders, the major competitors to Kabbage in this space include:
    * OnDeck Capital - has a higher qualifying threshold and traditional interest structure for revenue
    * Fundbox - Offers lower maximum funding ($100K vs. Kabbage's $250K)
    * BlueVine - Will work with younger businesses than Kabbage 
    * Lending Club - requires longer qualification processing but if an established business with good credit, has better terms than Kabbage.
    * Headway Capital - will work with younger businesses and has more forgiving repayment scheme.

## Results

* The business impact of Kabbage had been significant pre-COVID, with a large number of loans underwritten to small businesses.  However, their perceived greatest accomplishment has been as a delivery vehicle for the PPP.  
Kabbage states that more than 90\% of the PPP applications they processed for self-employed businesses were completely automated, and that the borrower didn’t have to communicate with anyone outside of the automated process. Many of the applicants received Small Business Administration approval on the same day. Regarding the PPP, founder Rob Frohwein has said:
> This has been fintech’s shining moment. Ten years ago there’s zero chance that most businesses we serve would’ve gotten funding. The banks would’ve only worked with much larger small businesses out there.”

* Traditional core metrics for institutions in lending space:
    * Pull Through Rate (Total Loans Funded/Applications Submitted)
    * Decision to Close Cycle Time (# of days to close a fund after underwriting)
    * Abandoned Loan Rate
    * Average Origination Value (revenue over time for the loan)
    * Application Approval Rate
    * Gross Charge-Off Rate (money that is never recovered on a debt)
    * Customer Acquisition Cost
    * Average Number of Conditions Per Loan
    
    Kabbage has disrupted the lending space by putting the process online and almost redefining some of the metrics - Acquisition Cost, Number of Conditions, Decision to Close are all algorithmically handled and contracted to a 10 minute approval process.  They have enjoyed a very high Pull Through and return on monies lent. 
    

* Kabbage has distinguished itself from its competitors by rapidly adapting to the pandemic induced contraction of the small business space.  By acting as an approver and conduit for the PPP, they have a government guaranteed loan source and do not have to underwrite these loans.     


## Recommendations

* It's difficult to imagine advising an already successful and disruptive startup.  Their success is based upon accessing an untapped market, and then being resilient enough to know how to service that market again in a paralyzing economic downturn. I would hazard to say that they should utilize their already proven algorithms and begin offering funding to another tier of businesses with an increased cap.  Rather than focus on the under-served market, they could begin to compete with traditional lenders servicing larger, older business, and take part of their market.
* Kabbage would benefit from such a strategy since it opens up their serviceable audience. The pandemic was an isolated specific circumstance, with the Small Business Administration offering the PPP as a life raft; Kabbage was positioned to easily dovetail into the process. Had the program not existed, Kabbage would probably have not survived.
* The additional offering would make appropriately make use of their existing technologies. As there is less scrutiny in lending to larger firms, there is also greater room for fraud in requesting funding.  Kabbage's algorithms could most probably detect questionable or illicit borrowing schemes, and evolve into an AI platform to detect fraudulent activity in the approval process for lending.
