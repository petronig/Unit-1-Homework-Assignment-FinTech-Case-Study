# Financial Case Study of Kabbage, Inc.

## Overview and Origin

* Kabbage, Inc.

* Incorporated February 12, 2009, based in Atlanta, Georgia

* Founders:
    * Rob Frohwein, CEO
    * Kathryn Petralia, President and "Kabbagehead"
    * Marc Gorlin

* The founders saw an opportunity during the 2008 financial crisis to USE AI to make small business lending more efficient and profitiable, without the high standards of cash flow, credit score or collateral required by banks.

* The company is privately held and funded by venture capital. Funding: $489 million as of 2021 from SoftBank Vision Fund, BlueRun Ventures, Mohr Davidow Ventures and others. Latest valuation: $1.2 billion


## Business Activities:

* Kabbage has focused on the cash flow obstacles faced by small buisinesses, both in initial funding and operations. Their suite of products includes Kabbage Payments, which assists small businesses in collecting payment and getting fast access to the earned money, and Kabbage Funding which provides access to flexible lines of credit in minutes.

* The target customer base has been small busineesses. The lines of credit extended are up to $250, 000 to those approved. As of 2020 Kabbage has provided loans to 220,000 small U.S. firms equating to $9 Billion in working capital.  The company claims that in three steps taking less than 10 minutes to transact, a small business may apply and potentially be approved for a credit line . They are able to do this having built the machine learning algorithms that allow extracting the real-time business data of the customers rather than relying on traditional bank statements and other static financial documents. 

In the midst of the pandemic, with many small businesses collaping and their customer base suddenly disappearing (there were employee furloughs at Kabbage summer of 2020), Kabbage re-invented its purpose by participating in the govenment funded Paycheck Protection Program which allows for companies to apply for 10 weeks of relief funding to pay employees impacted by the pandemic.  Kabbage provided over 130,00 PPP loans averaging $29,000.  Over 80\% of Kabbages PPP recipients were firms of five employees or fewer that did not have established relationships with banks. 

* Kabbage uses AI algorithms to analyze data and information from several sources including real-time cash flow data, bank accounts, e-commerce transactions, and online reviews, to evaluate the financial health of applicants. They also uses data sources, such as Amazon.com ratings, to evaluate individual creditworthiness and determine loan amounts. Kabbage licenses its algothimic underwriting technology and monitoring services to other financial institutions who then use its software to serve their small and medium-size business customers. As described by founder Kathryn Petralia, "We just call it 'AI-blockchain-crypto tech'".

## Landscape:

* Kabbage crosses over the two financial industry domains of Payments/Billing and Lending.

* The innovating trend over the past decade has been the accessibility of business funding to smaller firms and also to on-line and e-commerce companies.  The finacial needs of these firms could not be served, or were ignored by traditionsal banking systems that could not econonmically serve the sector.  The traditional requirements of three years banking history, financial statement, and tax history have been disrupted creating opprtunity for small businesses to access growth capital. 

* Aside from traditional lenders, the major competetors to Kabbage in this space include:
    * OnDeck Capital - has a higher qualifying threshold and traditional interest structure for revenue
    * Fundbox - Offers lower maximum funding ($100K vs. Kabbage's $250K)
    * BlueVine - Will work with youger businesses than Kabbage 
    * Lending Club - requires longer qualification processing but if an established business with good credit, has better terms than Kabbage.
    * Headway Capital - will work with younger buisnesses and has more forgiving repayment scheme.


## Results

* The buisinress impact of Kabbage had been significant pre-COVID, with a large number of loans underwitten to small buissesses.  However, their perceived greaest accomplishment has been as a delivery vehicle for the PPP.  
Kabbage states that more than 90\% of the PPP applications they processed for self-employed businesses were completely automated, and that the borrower didn’t have to communicate with anyone outside of the automated process. Many of the applicants received Small Buisiness Administration approval on the same day. Regarding the PPP, founder Rob Frohwein has said, "This has been fintech’s shining moment. Ten years ago there’s zero chance that most businesses we serve would’ve gotten funding. The banks would’ve only worked with much larger small businesses out there.”

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?Load underwritten

* Kabbage has distinquished itself from its competetors by rapidly adapting to the pandemic induced contraction of the small business space.  By acting as an approver and conduit for the PPP, they have a government guaranteed loan source and do not have to underwrite these loans.
